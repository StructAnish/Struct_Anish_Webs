        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Good day! In addition to developing software and websites, I'm also finishing up my B.Tech. in Computer Science and System Engineering. You may find me visiting new locations or attempting to beat my high score on the video game when I'm not coding or debugging.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about utilizing technology to resolve challenging issues and improve the world. Additionally, it gives you a good reason to spend the entire day in front of a computer.</p>

<p>Visit my website to find out more about who I am and what I do. And you've come to the correct spot if you need a developer who can both code && crack a good joke.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        
        <h2>Chroma</h2> 
        <p>
          •CHROMA is a platform that helps you figure out individuals around you
having similarinterests as yours.<br>
•It is made by using HTML, CSS, JS and mongoDB.<br>
•connect the people who have something to share, people who needs to
interact.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Wireless Capsule Endoscopy | Project</h2>

        <p>
          •We created a Machine Learning model which can detect any polyps, polyps and other abnormalities which can cause stomach cancer. <br>
          •We used TensorFlow to create a model with many layers which can help detecting cancer.
          •For various tasks in deep learning-based image processing, we import from Keras GaussianNoise, GlobalAveragePooling2D, BatchNormalization, Dropout, Dense, and Sequential.<br>
          •Our model can be used to detect the cancer in stomach more easily and quickly than traditional system.
        </p>
<h2>BB8 bot</h2>
<p>
  •Developed a gas sensing robot to save lives from underground gas poisoning.<br>
•Connects to a mobile phone via Bluetooth and raises and alarm if air quality drops
below survivable level.<br>
•Used Internet of Things to integrate a gas sensor and LDR with the Arduino
development platform.<br>
